  <article>
    Armani/Casa was founded in the year 2000 as a separate division, though seamlessly linked to the other "worlds‚Äù within the Armani Group, providing a platform for Giorgio Armani to set out his vision of the living space: an intimate and very special place, at one and the same time both comfortable and sophisticated.<br />The collection ranges from furniture to accessories, and from fabrics to ornaments and lighting.<br /><br />Today the catalogue also includes a modular arrangement for the bathroom and a complete kitchen system, thereby providing a solution to every essential furnishing requirement.<br /><br />Armani/Casa has a network of single brand stores and shop-in-shops in all major cities throughout the world, already covering 35 countries and growing continuously.<br />Further expansion of this division is on course with the creation of the hotel chain, Armani Hotels & Resorts, which Giorgio Armani is developing with specially created Armani/Casa furnishings, in conjunction with Emaar Properties.
