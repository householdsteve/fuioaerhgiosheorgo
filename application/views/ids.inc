All my homes reflect different and significant aspects of my personality, my life and my changing priorities, evolving gradually over time, while retaining their original character. They reflect my tastes and my passions, my aesthetic code and my profound need for comfort and functionality. </p><p>I always felt deeply passionate about the home, even before I launched Armani/Casa. Today I would like to share my vision and philosophical approach to living with the rest of the world. I want to create interiors in which people feel at ease and improve the aesthetic quality of their lives.”</p><p>Giorgio Armani </p>
